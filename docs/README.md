# Air Theme

A minimalistic blog theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) with a
simple sidebar, forked from [leonidasv](https://github.com/leonidasv/air-blog-theme-for-ghost).
I've added several features, including code highlighting, fixing glitches on the
tag page, and updating the body font. The code is fairly simple thanks to
Handlebars, so feel free to modify it for your own use -- PRs welcome!

## How to install:

* Make a zip file containing the repo
* Log in to Ghost administration panel
* Go to General > Themes > Upload a theme
* Find and select the previously created zip file
* Wait for upload completion and activate the new theme
